Checkout includes a Customer Dashboard template which provides your customers with easy access to their downloads, purchase history and account information.

To create the Customer Dashboard, first create a new page, add a title and tagline, and apply the Customer Dashboard template. Once you've published the page, head over to the Easy Digital Downloads settings. On the General settings tab, set your Success page to your new Customer Dashboard page. This will redirect users to their new, handy dashboard after they've been through the checkout.
