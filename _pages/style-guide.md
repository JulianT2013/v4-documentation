<h3>Highlight Text Style</h3>
To use the highlight, you simply need to <span class="highlight">add a span with the class <b>highlight</b></span>. This can be done in the Text editor view. See an example below:
<pre>&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;This will be highlighted.&lt;/span&gt;</pre>

<hr />

<h3>Image Alignment</h3>
[caption id="attachment_1405" align="aligncenter" width="1200"]<img src="https://gpdfv4.pv/app/uploads/2015/06/blank.jpg" alt="Center aligned!" width="1200" height="800" class="size-full wp-image-1405" /> Center aligned![/caption]

<hr />

<strong>Right Aligned Image</strong>

<img src="https://gpdfv4.pv/app/uploads/2015/06/blank-150x150.jpg" alt="blank" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1405" />

Images may be two-dimensional, such as a photograph, screen display, and as well as a three-dimensional, such as a statue or hologram. They may be captured by optical devices â€“ such as cameras, mirrors, lenses, telescopes, microscopes, etc. and natural objects and phenomena, such as the human eye or water surfaces.

<hr />

<strong>Left Aligned Image</strong>

<img src="https://gpdfv4.pv/app/uploads/2015/06/blank-150x150.jpg" alt="blank" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1405" />

The word image is also used in the broader sense of any two-dimensional figure such as a map, a graph, a pie chart, or an abstract painting. In this wider sense, images can also be rendered manually, such as by drawing, painting, carving, rendered automatically by printing or computer graphics technology, or developed by a combination of methods.

<hr />

<h3 id="pull-quotes">Pull Quote Styles</h3>
To use the pull quote, you simply need to add a class of <b>pull-right</b> or <b>pull-left</b> to your content. This can be done in the Text editor view. See an example below:
<pre>&lt;span class="pull-right"&gt;Pull this text right.&lt;/span&gt;</pre>
<span class="pull-right">This pull quote is just hanging out on the right side of the post. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur.</span>

A pull quote (also known as a lift-out quote) is a quotation or excerpt from an article that is typically placed in a larger or distinctive typeface on the same page, serving to entice readers into an article or to highlight a key topic. The term is principally used in journalism and publishing.

Placement of a pull quote on a page may be defined in a publication's or website's style guide. Such a typographic device may or may not be aligned with a column on the page. Some designers, for example, choose not to align the quote. In that case, the quotation cuts into two or more columns, as in the example shown.

<span class="pull-left">And this pull quote is pulling text to the left, like a sir. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur.</span>

Pull quotes need not be a verbatim copy of the text being quoted; depending on a publication's house style pull quotes may be abbreviated for space and/or paraphrased for clarity, with or without indication. There are no hard-and-fast rules for the exact formatting of pull quotes.
