# Gravity PDF 4.x Documentation

This is a wikiesque-style version controlled repo which houses the markdown files for all Gravity PDF's 4.x documentation.

We're using the amazing [WP GitHub Sync plugin](https://github.com/benbalter/wordpress-github-sync) by Ben Balter and James Di Gioia to automatically keep the documentation on WordPress in sync with this GitHub repository.

What that means is you can easily contribute to the Gravity PDF documentation. If you find a page that is out of date or ambiguous you can create a pull request to fix the problem and, once merged, will be automatically reflected on gravitypdf.com.
