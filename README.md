# Gravity PDF 4.x Documentation

This is a wikiesque-style repo which houses the markdown files for all Gravity PDF's 4.x documentation.

We're using the amazing [WP GitHub Sync plugin](https://github.com/benbalter/wordpress-github-sync) by Ben Balter and James Di Gioia to automatically keep the documentation on the Gravity PDF WordPress site in sync with this GitHub repository.

What that means is you can easily contribute to the Gravity PDF documentation. If you find a page that you feel is ambiguous or out of date, you can create a pull request to fix the problem and, once merged, the changes will be automatically reflected on gravitypdf.com.
