Several months ago, I ran into a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joeycofone/baron-fig-sketchbooks-and-notebooks-for-thinkers">Kickstarter</a> page for <a href="http://www.baronfig.com/">Baron Fig</a> notebooks. I was immediately struck by the aesthetic and simplicity that the notebook promised. Although I foolishly didn't back Baron Fig at the time, I was delighted to see they recently started shipping.

Fast forward to today, when I finally received a few of these notebooks in the mail. The build quality and paper are top-notch, and provide a great writing experience. I couldn't help but take a few photos of these beautiful notebooks.

Feel free to use these photos on any of your projects, commercial, personal or otherwise. They could make great Featured Images for your WordPress posts and pages, which is hopefully powered by an <a href="https://array.is/wordpress-themes/">Array theme</a>. If not, well, you should fix that immediately.
