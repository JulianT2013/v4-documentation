Gravity PDF is fully integrated into Gravity Forms. The PDF settings are located in a separate section in Gravity Forms own settings area. You can find them by navigating to `Forms -> Settings -> PDF` in your WordPress admin area. 

The PDF settings are split into three separate tabs: 

* [General](#general): Control defaults and security
* [Tools](#tools): Power user actions 
* [Help](#help): Search our documentation for assistance

### General Tab [(#general)](#general){#general}

From here you'll be able to control the PDF defaults like paper size, font and template. You also have advanced options giving you granular control over the security protocols. 



### Tools Tab [(#tools)](#tools){#tools}

Install additional fonts for use in your PDF documents, prepare your system for custom PDF templates and uninstall the plugin. 

Setup Custom Templates [(#custom-templates)](#custom-templates){#custom-templates}

Fonts [(#fonts)](#fonts){#fonts}

### Help Tab [(#help)](#help){#help}
