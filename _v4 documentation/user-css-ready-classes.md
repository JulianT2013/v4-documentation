![Snapshot of the CSS Ready PDF Classes](https://gpdfv4.pv/app/uploads/2015/10/css-ready.png) 

Gravity Forms display forms in a single column, but sometimes you want to condense everything and display the fields in two or three columns. This is why Gravity Forms introduced [CSS Ready Classes back in version 1.5](https://www.gravityhelp.com/documentation/article/css-ready-classes/). They included a number of pre-set class names that allows you to easily style your form.

Until recently Gravity PDF suffered from the same issue â€“ only a single column PDF was generated. But in version 4.0 we redesigned the system to better support this feature. If you add columns to your Gravity Form they will be reflected in the PDF as well.
