Once you've successfully configured a PDF on one of your Gravity Forms you'll be able to view and download the PDFs from the [Gravity Forms entries page](https://www.gravityhelp.com/documentation/article/entries/). 

### Entry List [#entry-list](#entry-list){#entry-list}

When viewing the entries list a "View PDF" or "View PDFs" link will be added to each entry's quick toolbar â€“ which gets displayed when you hover over the first cell of any entry. Depending on your [Entry View](https://gpdfv4.pv/v4-docs/user-global-settings/#view) setting this action will open a new window and show the PDF in your browser, or prompt you to download the PDF. 

### Entry Details [#entry-details](#entry-details){#entry-details}

You can also view and download your PDFs from the [entry details page](https://www.gravityhelp.com/documentation/article/entry-detail/). A new *PDF* heading will be included under the right *Entry* sidebar widget and allow you to view and download PDFs.
